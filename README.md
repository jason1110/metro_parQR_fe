## About

Metro ParQR is my Idea for a solution to Parking Meter woes in a city, It makes managing your meter easier by managing your length of stay at the meter, and helping you keep track of where you parked.

## Getting Started
 

#Techs to make sure are installed:

Node  --> Not unless you want to make changes to the backend. which can be cloned [here](https://github.com/jason1110/metro-parQR-be)
Dart
Flutter
Android Studio
Xcode --> Prewarning: I do not have Xcode installed and did not tailor this app for iOS, so I'm not sure what will be different.
I used VSCode for this, so I'd recommend installing the Dart and Flutter extensions

## Features

* Create a new user or Login as an existing user
* Once logged in, a user view available parking meters on the map.
* When the user is parked at a meter, they will use their phone to scan a QR code which contains the parkingn meter information.
* The user can then decide to stay at the meter and pay the meter on their phone for the desired amount of time. 
* The user will be able to add time to the meter, and locate their parked car once they are registered at the meter.
